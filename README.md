# URL Checker
## Description
 - **Input** is a file with URL's.
 - **Output** is a result of http request to every correct url of the input file.

## Why
It's a study project. 
I just was reading a book about application designing patterns, where examples was exactly in Java ツ
So that I desided to create this project as a practice.

## There is no documentation
I dont think it would be useful for someone and almost sure that I give up it soon.
